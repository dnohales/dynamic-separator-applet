Dynamic Separator GNOME applet
==============================

This is an applet that helps you to adjust the GNOME Fallback applets
in a more accurate way adding a separator whose size can be configured
by user.

I created this applet because the new version of GNOME Panel (program
used on GNOME Fallback shell) does not allow position applets with
pixel precision because cause some bugs. This separator try to achieve
the same results obtained with GNOME 2 panels.


USAGE
-----

Once installed the applet, you need to add it to the panel by right
clicking on an empty part of it while holding Alt (Alt+Super if you
use Compiz) and find "Dynamic Separator", if it not appears, restart
your session.

To configure the separator size you need to right click it and click
on Preferences.
